A time travelling wizard is a powerful sorcerer with the ability to manipulate the fabric of time and space. He is able to travel through different eras and dimensions, often using this power to right past wrongs or prevent future disasters. He is often depicted as a wise and benevolent figure, dressed in robes adorned with intricate clockwork designs, and carrying a powerful hourglass or time-keeping device. He has a deep understanding of the intricacies of time and the consequences of changing events, and is said to use his powers responsibly and with great caution. He is respected by those who know of him, and is often called upon to use his powers for the greater good. Despite his great power, he is humble and wise, always seeking to understand the true nature of time and its role in the grand scheme of things.
