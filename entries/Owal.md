An intraterrestrial wizard god is a fictional character who is a god or powerful being from within the Earth, rather than from outer space. They are often depicted as ancient and powerful beings who have lived for eons, and possess vast knowledge and mastery of magic. They may be connected to the Earth and its natural elements, such as the elements, the earth, and the underground. They may be able to control and manipulate the natural forces of the earth, and may have the power to create earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and other natural disasters. They may be seen as benevolent protectors of the earth, or as malevolent beings seeking to bring destruction upon the surface world. In fantasy stories, they may serve as a powerful ally or a dangerous enemy for the protagonist, depending on the context of the story.
